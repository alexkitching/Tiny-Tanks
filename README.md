# Tiny Tanks Recreation

**1st Year University Project** <br/>
**Semester 2** <br/>
**Programming and Mathematics for Games**
 
 This is my second assignment after the Asteroids Recreation.
 
 I was tasked with recreating TinyTanks similar to the Flash or Wii Game.
 Also I was required to create a Math Library containing Vector and Matrix Classes which were utilised in the development of the Game.
 
 **Features:** <br/>
 2 Player Local Gameplay <br/>
 Tank Combat <br/>
 Collision Detection <br/>
 Powerups (Ammo, Homing Missile, Lives, Random) <br/>
 Animated Sprites <br/>
 Basic Splash Menu <br/>
 
 **Skills Demonstrated:** <br/>
 Inheritance <br/>
 Game Programming Design Concepts (Game Loop, Game States, State Machines, Singleton, Collision Detection, Advanced Collision Detection - GJK, Controller Objects) <br/>
 Vector and Matrix Math <br/>
 Const Correctness <br/>
